# CodeHER

An interactive website to motivate students to build good saving habits! Basic layout and functionality developed at the CodeHER+ hackathon, run by the UVic Women in Engineering and Computer Science club.

Main goals:
- Motivation: provide encouragements from the site mascot to make the budgeting process fun.
- Visualisation: display financial data in interactive graphs that make your progress clear.
- Ease of use: make it easy to input budgeting data, so it becomes an efficient step in daily life.
